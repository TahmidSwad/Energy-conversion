# Transformer
## Definition
A transformer is a static device where electric power in one circuit is transformed into electric power of the same frequency in another circuit. It can raise or lower the voltage in a circuit but with a corresponding decrease or increase in current. The physical basis of a transformer is mutual induction between two circuits linked by a common magnetic flux.

### Concepts
- Magnetic Flux : Rate of change of magnetic field.

- Magnetic Field : A magnetic field is a region in space where magnetic forces are experienced. It's created by the motion of electric charges, such as electrons, or by the intrinsic magnetic properties of certain materials

- Electric Field : A vector field surrounding charged particles or objects that exerts a force on other charged particles and is characterized by its strength and direction.

- Changing Electric Fields : When an electric field changes with time, it induces a magnetic field. Oscillating electric fields induce corresponding oscillating magnetic fields, and vice versa.

- Changing Magnetic Fields : Changing magnetic fields induce electric fields. This is evident in electromagnetic induction, where a changing magnetic field through a coil of wire induces an electromotive force (EMF) or voltage across the coil, resulting in the generation of an electric current.

- The electromagnetic induction law, formulated by Michael Faraday, states that a changing magnetic field in a closed loop of wire induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the wire loop, which in turn generates an electric current.

- Lenz's Law states that the direction of the induced electromotive force (EMF) or current generated by electromagnetic induction will always oppose the change that produced it. In simpler terms, it means that the induced current in a circuit will flow in a direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux that caused it.

- The Biot-Savart Law describes the magnetic field produced by a steady current in a conductor. It states that the magnetic field strength at a point in space due to a small element of current-carrying conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through that element, the length of the element, and the sine of the angle between the direction of the current and the line joining the element to the point, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the element to the point.

- Fleming's Right-Hand Rule (Motor Rule): If the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of the right hand are positioned mutually perpendicular to each other, with the index finger pointing in the direction of the magnetic field (North to South), the middle finger pointing in the direction of the current, then the thumb will point in the direction of the resulting force or motion. This rule is commonly used to predict the direction of the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field.

- Fleming's Left-Hand Rule (Generator Rule):
If the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of the left hand are positioned mutually perpendicular to each other, with the index finger pointing in the direction of the magnetic field (North to South), the middle finger pointing in the direction of motion (or induced current), then the thumb will point in the direction of the induced current (or force). This rule is typically used to predict the direction of the induced current in a conductor moving through a magnetic field, as occurs in a generator.

- Reluctance refers to the opposition offered by a material or a magnetic circuit to the passage of magnetic flux.

## Working Principle
In simplest form a transformer is consists of two inductive coils which are electrically separated but magnetically linked through a path of low reluctance. If one coil is connected to a source of alternating voltage, an alternating flux is set up in the laminated core,most of which is linked with the other coil in which it produces mutually-induced e.m.f. If the second coil circuit is closed, a current flows in it and so electric energy is transferred entirely magnetically from the first coil to the second coil.

## Losses
Hysteresis loss - Residual flux due to residual magnetism (the magnetic flux that remains in the core when the magnetic field is reduced to zero) of one cycle collides with the subsequent cycles and results in the conversion of electrical energy into heat within the transformer core. This is known as hysteresis loss.

Eddy current loss - EMF that is induced not in the secondary coil but the core itself, and so a current circulates within the shorted path of the core leading to a energy dissipation as heat. This is known as eddy current loss.

Leakage flux -  Leakage flux refers to the portion of the magnetic flux that does not follow the intended path between the transformer's primary and secondary windings. Instead, it leaks outside the core and links with only one of the windings. It represents the magnetic flux not effectively coupled between the primary and secondary windings, leading to energy losses. 
Leakage reactance is the reactance introduced by the leakage flux when an alternating current flows through the windings. It contributes to the total impedance in the transformer and influences the voltage regulation. It is particularly important in considering the performance of a transformer under load conditions.
