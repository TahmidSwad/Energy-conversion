# Transformer
## Definition
A transformer is a static device where electric power in one circuit is transformed into electric power of the same frequency in another circuit. It can raise or lower the voltage in a circuit but with a corresponding decrease or increase in current. The physical basis of a transformer is mutual induction between two circuits linked by a common magnetic flux.
In simplest form a transformer is consists of two inductive coils which are electrically separated but magnetically linked through a path of low reluctance.
If one coil is connected to a source of alternating voltage, an alternating flux is set up in the laminated core,most of which is linked with the other coil in which it produces mutually-induced e.m.f. If the second coil circuit is closed, a current flows in it and so electric energy is transferred entirely magnetically from the first coil to the second coil.

## Losses
Hysteresis loss - Residual flux due to residual magnetism (the magnetic flux that remains in the core when the magnetic field is reduced to zero) of one cycle collides with the subsequent cycles and results in the conversion of electrical energy into heat within the transformer core. This is known as hysteresis loss.

Eddy current loss - EMF that is induced not in the secondary coil but the core itself, and so a current circulates within the shorted path of the core leading to a energy dissipation as heat. This is known as eddy current loss.

Leakage flux -  Leakage flux refers to the portion of the magnetic flux that does not follow the intended path between the transformer's primary and secondary windings. Instead, it leaks outside the core and links with only one of the windings. It represents the magnetic flux not effectively coupled between the primary and secondary windings, leading to energy losses.
Leakage reactance is the reactance introduced by the leakage flux when an alternating current flows through the windings. It contributes to the total impedance in the transformer and influences the voltage regulation. It is particularly important in considering the performance of a transformer under load conditions.
